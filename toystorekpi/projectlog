Toy Store KPI Dashboard â€“ Project Log

Tools used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Excel (CSV files)

ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation
Connected to four source files: sales, products, stores, and calendar CSVs.

Reviewed data structure, cleaned null/blank values, validated data types, and identified primary & foreign keys.

Profiled the data to extract key insights, including transaction volume, number of stores, and product pricing range.

Added calculated columns to the calendar table for Start of Month and Start of Week to enable time-based analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling
Loaded the tables into the Power BI data model and built a star schema with proper 1:many relationships between the sales fact table and related dimension tables (products, stores, calendar).

Created a date hierarchy (Date > Start of Week > Start of Month) to support drill-down analysis.

Hid all foreign key columns in the report view to simplify the user interface.

ðŸ”¹ Calculated Fields & Measures
Created calculated columns to retrieve cost and price for each sale and used them to compute revenue and profit per transaction.

Defined key measures including Total Orders, Total Revenue, and Total Profit.

Bonus: Created alternate revenue/profit measures using DAX instead of calculated columns.

ðŸ”¹ Report & Dashboard Design
Built an interactive report with:

KPI cards displaying monthly totals for orders, revenue, and profit.

Bar chart showing orders by product category.

Line chart tracking revenue trends over time using the custom date hierarchy.

Slicer for filtering by store location.

Organized visuals into a clear layout, refined formatting, and added interactive features for improved user experience.
